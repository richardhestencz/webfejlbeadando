                Yasuo, the Unforgiven, was once a proud swordsman from the prestigious Wind Slash style school. However, when he was falsely accused of murdering his elder brother, he was forced to flee into the night. Alone and pursued by both the Noxian invaders and the Ionian authorities, Yasuo became a skilled assassin, using his Wind Slash style to quickly and efficiently dispatch his enemies. Eventually, Yasuo found peace within himself and was ready to face his past. He sought out the elders of the Wind Slash style and confessed his mistake. The elders were surprised by his honesty and humility, and they allowed him to rejoin the Wind Slash style. </p>

                Volibear
                Volibear, the Thunder's Roar, is a colossal ursine demigod who commands the thunder and lightning of Freljord. He is a force of nature, a living embodiment of the primal power of the frozen realm.
                Volibear was once a humble ursine shaman, revered by his people for his wisdom and connection to the spirit world. However, when a cataclysmic event shook Freljord to its core, Volibear's powers were awakened. He became a conduit for the raw elemental energy of the land, capable of summoning thunder and lightning at will.</p>
