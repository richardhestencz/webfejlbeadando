            <p class="balos">League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. The game was released in 2009 and has since become one of the most popular video games in the world, with over 100 million active players.</p>
            <p class="balos">In LoL, two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other's base. Each champion has unique abilities and strengths, and players must work together to utilize their champion's strengths to achieve victory. The game is played on a map called the Rift, which is divided into three lanes. Players must push their minions down each lane in order to destroy the enemy's towers and eventually their Nexus, which is located in their base.</p>

            <h2 class="alcim">The map</h2>
            <p class="balos">The map of League of Legends is called the Rift. It is a symmetrical map that is divided into three lanes: top, mid, and bottom. Each lane has three towers that the teams must destroy in order to reach the enemy's Nexus, which is located in their base. The Nexus is the main objective of the game, and the first team to destroy it wins the match.</p>
